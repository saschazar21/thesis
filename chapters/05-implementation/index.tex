\chapter{Implementation}
\label{cha:implementation}

After shaping a basic theoretical approach and probably sketching different considerations, it is time to define the needed tools and setting up a project repository. Also, it has to be considered, that the finished project should depend on as little third-party software as possible, but also be as deployable as possible.

At the very beginning, a clear structure has to be adopted, which concurrently serves as navigation guide for later development. Having a folder structure ready at development start, it may seem rigid and even narrow down the developer's freedom in creating his/her part of the application logic during some part of the process, but nevertheless it is definitely an important and easy supporting tool for projects being maintained using an asynchronous collaboration workflow. Furthermore, it may even help in creating tasks focusing on certain parts of the development process.
