To prove the project's usability, it has not only to be tested against a ``real'' setup; additionally, it also has to be tested against different settings. Since it was designed to be as unopinionated as possible, there are still challenges to face concerning the overall support of different third-party tools, like template engines, etc\ldots

Nevertheless, a base repository for future building using the REST API is set up without much hassle. As the project features a generic Metalsmith instance building and rendering the different website projects, a local installation setup might as well be useful prior to handing the repository over to the REST API. This might help in fixing bugs, which are probably much easier detected, if the source code is at hand.
