To prove the project's usability, it has not only to be tested against a ``real'' setup; additionally, it also has to be tested against different settings. Since it was designed to be as unopinionated as possible, there are still challenges to face concerning the overall support of different third-party tools, like template engines, etc.

Nevertheless, a base repository for future building using the REST API is set up without much hassle. As the project features a generic Metalsmith instance for building and rendering the different website projects, a local installation setup might as well be useful prior to handing over the repository to the REST API. This might support fixing bugs, which are probably much easier detected, if the source code is at hand.
