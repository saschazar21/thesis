\chapter{Theoretical approach}
\label{cha:theoreticalapproach}

Once a decision is made in favor of a project using a static site generator, first challenges may already arise:

\begin{itemize}
  \item What kind of media is being used? Images, videos, or just text?
  \item How is the project structured? How many independent permalink structures are there?
  \item How many content authors are there? How often is content added or altered?
  \item How steady is the site design? Does the site have more than one independent design flow?
\end{itemize}

Some issues described by one or more of the questions above may not be improved in a predictable amount of time. Some of them are mostly content-related, others are related to development. Even in projects where only a high amount of content productivity is pursued, developers are forced to keep the build pipeline performant and responsive to the content author's needs.
