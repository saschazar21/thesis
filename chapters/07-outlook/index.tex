Since this project has to be merely seen as a proof of concept, a few open points still remain. One of them would be the possibility of including it into a project workflow as a continuous integration service. By acting as an interface between GitHub and any deployment service, which is able to decompress a tar.gz archive, it would be the missing link for an automated update process to the web hosting service.

However, for extending the precision and usability of the REST API, some additional enhancements are necessary, where each of them is likely to form the extent of a project of its own.
