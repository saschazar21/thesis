\section{GitHub}
\label{sec:git-github}

Already mentioned it a few times before (see p. \pageref{sec:jekyll}, \pageref{sec:buildpipelines-markdown} or \pageref{sec:git}), \texttt{GitHub} is currently probably the most popular online collaboration platform, hosting not only the source code for the \emph{Linux} kernel\footnote{\url{https://github.com/torvalds/linux} -- Linux kernel repository on \texttt{GitHub}.}, but also for other huge projects like Google's \emph{TensorFlow}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow} -- Tensorflow repository on \texttt{GitHub}.}, Microsoft's \emph{.NET}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet} -- .NET repository on \texttt{GitHub}.} or Facebook's \emph{React}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/facebook/react} -- React repository on \texttt{GitHub}.}.

\subsection{History}
\emph{Tom Preston-Werner}, a \texttt{Ruby} programmer from San Francisco and creator of earlier mentioned \texttt{Jekyll} (see ch. \ref{sec:jekyll} on p. \pageref{sec:jekyll}) and \emph{Chris Wanstrath} started developing \texttt{GitHub} in October 2007. After releasing a private beta in January, they released the site to the public on April 10\textsuperscript{th}, 2008 \cite{PrestonWerner2008githublaunch}.

Since then, \texttt{GitHub} grew very fast and quickly gained on popularity throughout the developer landscape, hosting more than 56 million projects today\footnote{\url{https://github.com/about} -- GitHub's ``about'' page.}. Thanks to their generous freemium pricing model, collaborating in open source projects still is for free: A free tier account may hold unlimited open source repositories, working together with unlimited contributors\footnote{\url{https://github.com/pricing} -- GitHub's pricing page.}. All in all it seems, that \texttt{GitHub} turned coding into a truly social activity \cite[416]{loeliger2012version}.

\subsection{Technology}
The main use case for creating a repository on \texttt{GitHub} is the fact, that unlike other privately hosted remote repositories, it offers a wide range of additional services. Services like \emph{Issue tracking, Pull requests} and \emph{Code reviews} leverage the maintainability of source code in a repository, making it easy for each developer to discuss and manage the current project state without the need of switching to a third party application.

Especially for content authors without programming knowledge, the \emph{In-Page Code Editor} might be a very supportive tool, as it provides a clean and easy-to-use frontend for directly adding content to the repository (see Fig. \ref{fig:github-page-editor}). Additionally, the just edited file may not only be committed into the currently selected branch, but also in a newly created branch. Therefore, the source branch stays clean, whereas the edited file may get reviewed by an assigned supervisor, before being ready to get merged.\\
Furthermore, also developers might make use of this feature, especially when a small hotfix is to be made, where it would be too time-consuming to \emph{pull, commit} and \emph{push} from/to the repository \cite[405]{loeliger2012version}.

Pushing to a \texttt{gh-pages} branch, or creating a \texttt{<username>.github.io} repository, enables the use of \texttt{GitHub's} built-in website hosting service. From there, either a \texttt{Jekyll} project is freshly built, or already compiled static \texttt{HTML} are automatically published to the web -- additionally, custom domains may be used when adding a \texttt{CNAME} file \cite[p. 171f]{dhillon2016}.
