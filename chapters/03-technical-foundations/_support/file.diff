 Hello,
-this line gets deleted in newfile.txt,
-as well as this, so both get prefixed with a minus
+
 This line stays the same, but is preceded
 by a blank line, which gets prefixed with a plus
+Oh yes, and this line got added in newfile.txt
 All other lines staying the same as in oldfile.txt
 are prefixed with a blank space.
    (such as this, which should be a blank line)
+   (but not this, as it also got added in newfile.txt)
+Good bye (also added)
