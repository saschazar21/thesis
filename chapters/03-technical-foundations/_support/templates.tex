\subsection{Templates}
\label{sec:buildpipelines-templates}

\emph{Templates} are the frames of each content page, caring for a common, browser-readable \texttt{HTML} structure. A uniform design layout allows site-wide look and feel using a global \texttt{CSS} style sheet, as well as certain events triggered by user behaviour, handled by a single \texttt{JavaScript} file.

Born out of the need to fail-safe produce \texttt{HTML} on the server, as the produced data chunks -- initiated by a client \texttt{HTTP} request -- steadily grew, the goal behind templating engines is primarily to separate business logic from data display. Ideally, at the end of the day, there should be no code in \texttt{HTML}, and no \texttt{HTML} in code \cite[225]{Parr2004templates}.

A simple template file example for a blog post is shown in Listing \ref{list:handlebars}. It is written in \texttt{Handlebars}, a very basic templating language, offering only a very limited amount of template logic. Included are \emph{loops, if/else, partials, \ldots} -- however, additional ``\emph{helper}''-functions may be added by the developer.
