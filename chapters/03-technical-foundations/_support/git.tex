\section{Git}
\label{sec:git}

Today, hardly any software project is started without any form of version control system (\texttt{VCS}). It supports developers as a back-up system and living archive of their work, as data generally is ephemeral and can be lost easily \cite[1]{loeliger2012version}. Although there are many different variations offered, some of the most popular today are \emph{Git, Apache Subversion, Mercurial} and \emph{Bazaar}.

\subsection{History}
\label{sec:git-history}
\texttt{Git} was initially published by \emph{Linus Torvalds} on April 7\textsuperscript{th}, 2005 \cite[6]{loeliger2012version}. This was necessary, as the ``free'' version of the then used VCS for the \emph{Linux} kernel development, \texttt{BitKeeper}, was restricted in a way it was not suitable any longer for the community behind it. Furthermore, the search of an already available alternative to the \texttt{BitKeeper} system failed due to an unsatisfying combination of needed features, so \emph{Torvalds} came up with his own VCS flavor, containing all desired functionalities for further \emph{Linux} development (among others) \cite[4]{loeliger2012version}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Distributed development
  \item Handle thousands of developers
  \item Efficient performance
  \item Support branched development
  \item Free, as in freedom
\end{itemize}

While it was merely a tool for kernel hackers in the beginning, its simplicity quickly made developers use it for other projects too. However, the CLI still scared off people with less programming background, until \texttt{GitHub} came and introduced its Desktop client\footnote{\url{https://desktop.github.com/} -- GitHub Desktop client.}. Today, it is one of many GUIs, which are available for different operating systems\footnote{\url{https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis} -- Git GUI clients on the \texttt{git} website.} and completely omits the necessity of terminal emulator knowledge when working with \texttt{git}.

%% Write something, why it is so famous. distributed development - other use cases .. blargh.
