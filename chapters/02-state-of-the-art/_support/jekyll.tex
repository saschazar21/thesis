\section{Jekyll}
\label{sec:jekyll}

As already described in section <<\emph{\nameref{par:creatingcontent}}>> on p. \pageref{par:creatingcontent}, \texttt{Jekyll} was created out of the need for avoiding to service the blogging engine before writing and publishing content.

\emph{Tom Preston-Werner}, co-founder of \texttt{GitHub}\footnote{\url{https://github.com} -- GitHub Inc.}, announced it in October 2008 in one of his blog posts \cite{PrestonWerner2008jekyll}. Already in December 2008, it was introduced as build engine for the then newly featured \textbf{GitHub Pages} service, allowing owners of repositories to publish a static website by just pushing to a certain \texttt{master} or \texttt{gh-pages} branch \cite{PrestonWerner2008githubpages}, which is still available for free to this day.

All of this happened just 6 (respectively 8) months after \texttt{GitHub} was launched \cite{PrestonWerner2008githublaunch} and is now even being used by technology-leading companies to showcase their Open-Source efforts\footnote{\url{https://github.com/showcases/github-pages-examples} -- GitHub Pages examples.}.
