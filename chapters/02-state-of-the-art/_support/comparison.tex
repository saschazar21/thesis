\section{Comparison}
\label{sec:comparison}

To conclude the summaries of different static site generators, a short overview using a table is given below (see Table \ref{table:comparison}). The comparison is built up on advantages and disadvantages, as well as the most important features they consist of. Therefore overall popularity and customizability play an as important role, as the language they are written in. However, Metalsmith is standing a little bit out, as it does not provide a full-featured framework -- it merely serves as the basis for further plugin setup, whereas Jekyll and Hexo already contain some sort of standard setup.
The numbers of plugins in Table \ref{table:comparison} were taken from search queries on \url{https://npms.io} and \url{https://rubygems.org}.
