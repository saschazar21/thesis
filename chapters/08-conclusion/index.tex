\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion}

The main interest for static site generators evolved during my work at a performance management company based in Linz, Upper Austria. I was impressed by the simplicity of generating HTML content without having to construct an extensive interface before actually getting to the point of actually creating content. One of the major drawbacks although was the idle time I had to face during a rendering cycle.

The project I used to work with was initially based on Jekyll, but with some strong customizations added to the build pipeline setup. Consisting of a reasonable amount of content files, a build cycle sometimes lasted more than 20 minutes -- mostly due to heavy tasks, such as picture resizing, etc\ldots

\paragraph{}
As a conclusion, I can now say, the most interesting part about my research was not only to find ways to overcome those local performance issues during rebuilds, but also trying to leverage the common workflow in moving as many local tasks to a remote workspace as possible. This should support content authors and developers in focusing on their core jobs by taking unnecessary responsibilities off their hands.
